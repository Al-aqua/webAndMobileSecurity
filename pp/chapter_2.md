# What is Encryption?

- **Definition**: The process of converting plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext to protect it from unauthorized access
- **Types of encryption**: 
  - Symmetric encryption (e.g., AES)
  - Asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA)

---

# What is OpenSSL?

- **Definition**: A software library for encryption, decryption, and other cryptographic operations using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.
- **Features**: 
  - Generating public and private keys
  - Encrypting and decrypting data
  - Creating digital certificates
  - Supporting various encryption algorithms

# Digital Certificates

- **Definition**: A digital certificate is a file that contains a public key and identity information about the owner of the key.
- **Types of digital certificates**:
  - Self-signed certificates
  - CA-signed certificates

# Securing Web Communications with SSL/TLS

- **Definition**: SSL/TLS is a protocol for encrypting web communications between a client and a server
- **How it works**:
  1. The client initiates a connection to the server
  2. The server responds with its digital certificate
  3. The client verifies the certificate and establishes an encrypted connection

- **Definition**: SSH is a protocol for secure remote access to a computer or network
- **Features**: 
  - Encryption of data in transit
  - Authentication using passwords or public keys
  - Secure file transfer
